# Atari Pong 1972
A simple 2D pong game with realistic physics against AI made with Pygame on Python 3.6 to improve the laylib-paygame framwork. 
                The game parameters can be changed from the constants.py file, as example to make 
                the AI ​​more aggressive, go ahead and reduce the values AI_MAX_REACT and MAX_ERR_INT.
                
Nota bene : This first program didn't respect the PEP8 convention or any another python-specific convention. Dont take it as reference.
